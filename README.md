# 🚀 Task 03 - Decision Tree Classifier

This repository contains my submission for **Task 03** of the Data Science Internship at **Prodigy Infotech**.

 📌 Objective:
Build a Decision Tree Classifier using the **Bank Marketing Dataset** to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on their demographic and behavioral data.

 📂 Dataset:
- Source: [UCI ML Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing) / [Prodigy GitHub](https://github.com/Prodigy-InfoTech/data-science-datasets/tree/main/Task%203)
- File used: `bank.csv`
- Target variable: `y` (yes/no - subscription to term deposit)

 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used:
---> Python
---> Pandas, NumPy
---> Matplotlib, Seaborn
---> Scikit-learn
---> Google Colab

 📊 Project Steps:
1. Loaded the dataset and handled semicolon separators
2. Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA)
3. Encoded categorical variables using `LabelEncoder`
4. Split data into training and testing sets
5. Built a Decision Tree Classifier using entropy as the splitting criterion
6. Evaluated the model using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report
7. Visualized the decision tree

 ✅ Results:
---> Achieved accuracy of ~85–90% on test data
--->Identified important features influencing customer subscription decisions
